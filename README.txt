MPEG for MATLAB
---------------

This is an implementation of the MPEG psychoacoustic model 1, layer I,
for MATLAB. It has been tested on MATLAB 5.2 running on Windows NT.
All you have to do is to copy the ".m" files into a directory.

The original implementation is freely available from:

    <http://petitcolas.net/fabien/software/mpeg/>


This package contains an optimsed implementation by Teddy Furon,
of Télécom Paris. You will have to modify the code in MPEG_Test.m
in order to be able to use it since it only computes the 
phychoacoustic model.

This implementation is based on

    Information technology -- Coding of moving pictures and associated
    audio for digital storage media at up to about 1,5 Mbit/s -- Part
    3: audio. British Standard, BSI, London. First edition 1993-08-01.
